# hello-motherf-ers!!

Welcome to my f-ing GitHub page, where eventually you will find all kinds of sh-t (I hope)! 


So I've been out of touch for like.. ten years and although I used to be into computers or computing or whatever the f-ck you want to call it (Even going to college for IT 8 years ago), I always thought programming or coding was for the 'real' nerds, who wear spectacles and sh-t everytime they drink milk, clearly it isn't and I'm just stupid for thinking so.

At the time of writing, I've just got to grips with HTML and CSS (I know, roll out the f-ing red carpet); f-ck knows who's d-ck I've got to suck to swallow Javascript, Get PHP or be injected with knowledge of SQL.

I didn't want to learn how to use any libraries, because I thought that would be a stupid waste of time!

Oh how f-ing stupid I am!

I am at the stage where I understand why most use libraries and frameworks (Re-inventing the wheel is the REAL waste of time; unless it's square, obviously).

Decided that I don't want to be a web developer anymore and I want to be a software engineer!

C-NT!

I just want to make a hotel reservation system or something to get me started, I've worked in hotels and restaurants and they are all sh-t and they cost $$$^10.

It seems like Java (The one I want to learn), is a slow process and takes time to learn, Python (The one that's taking over) is not the best language to start with as you can pick up bad habits and C has too many variants to the point that just deciding which one to look at has tipped me over the edge.

And these are just the easy ones. I looked a binary but, sh-t, why do I make life so hard for myself?

I'm obviously going to have to start with Java, though I should probably learn Javascript and PHP first to finish off my web development stack. F-ck it I'm committing to Java, right here, right now, fuck everything else.

Wait let me just look up some shit quick, PHP, easy to learn? f-ck of, I read a book, literally, skimmed it, across the scanner at the library when I took it back. 

Maybe I should invest in some glasses..

Nah f-ck it, I can see that I'm going to have to learn more than just one language anyway, although python is the quickest, I f-ing love a bad habit (like swearing) so I'm going to learn Java, then python, the C ++, sound good?




Still here? F-ck off!!
